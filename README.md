# Graph Style Specification

The Graph Style specification can be associated with a visualized graph.  GS works very well with structural graph formats such as JGF as you can associate multiple graph style descriptions with a set of graphs to highlight associated metadata (e.g. highlight proteins in red versus carbohydrates in blue). This allows you to keep visualization style-specific information out of the graph structure and allows easy application of multiple visual styles with a given graph.
